# CS-370-Course - Current/Emerging Trends in CS
#
This course was my first glimpse into machine learning.  In this course, we studied various machine learning algorithms such as Reinforcement Learning with 
Deep Q neural networks, and the attached project code is an example.  We were given a template that contained the set up for a machine to learn a Treasure Hunting game.
The template contained pseudo code that we needed to review in order to create the deep Q learning algorithm that would train the agent to solve the pathfinding maze problem.

#What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
     As we learned in this course, Artificial Intelligence should be something that is a benefit to society.  Machine Learning has the potential to be extremely
     beneficial and the computer scientists that train the machine need to be ethical and responsible.  I believe that a computer scientist should take this approach
     to the programs that they help to design and to ensure that the work they do is providing a useful purpose for the general good of society.  Therefore, a computer
     scientist is someone who is trained on various system design and coding techniques that can assist a user or a business in accomplishing their goals by applying
     their skills in computer science. 
#How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
     For approaching a problem as a computer scientist it is necessary to first understand exactly what the problem is by interviewing the user and gathering
     as many facts as possible. Once the problem has been determined, it is time to research existing technologies in order to be able to provide a solution
     that will most benefit the solution for the user. The solution should be SMART -> specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time bound.
#What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
     As a specialist in technology, a computer scientist is able to understand solutions to technical problems and has the responsibility to ensure that
     they are following ethical practices.  A computer scientist can provide detailed explanations to technical products that a person without that training 
     cannot.  A computer scientist needs to ensure that they are providing not only a solution, but an ethical one that is capable of solving a problem in a 
     realistic manner and that the user will be able to carry forward.  A computer scientist also needs to ensure that the work they are asked to do is to create
     a solution to a problem in an ethical manner.
